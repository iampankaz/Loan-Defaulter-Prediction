# Loan-Defaulter-Prediction
A personal loan is an unsecured credit provided by financial institutions based on criteria like employment history, repayment capacity, income level, profession, and credit history. This is also known as a consumer loan or a multi-purpose loan, and it helps the borrower meet any of their immediate needs. One of the leading bankers in US has approached you to predict on the defaulters with the help of the recent data on the personal loans availed by various customers. You are now asked to build a robust machine learning model that would distinguish the future applicants who might default and help the bank to take proactive measures.
